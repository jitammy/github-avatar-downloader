I have your file in my current folder
### When
I execute your file using node, providing a github user and repository as command-line arguments For example: $ node download_avatars.js nodejs node
### Then
I should find a folder called avatars in my current directory
The avatars folder should contain images corresponding to the avatars of the contributors of the repo
